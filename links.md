1. [Git and Github in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG4Vs81kMlc)<br>
A video guide by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)
. He will teach you all the basics of git and github if you somehow forget about it
one day lmao. All of this 30 minutes information is enough for you to start using
git and github right after you finish this video. Also check his other vids,
he teaches a lot of good stuff.
2. [Beginner guide to SSH](https://youtu.be/qWKK_PNHnnA)<br>

this SSH thing. I want to know how these things works so i searched in youtube

4. [Pointers in C and C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-in-c-and-c-set-1-introduction-arithmetic-and-array/)<br>
Pointers may seems scary for beginner C and C++ programmer, well even for some people who
used C and C++ for a while (like me) still think it's confusing. This website's explanation
on pointers is easy to understand (at least for me). I think this might help you too.
5. [What is SWAP area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgefj9ibRE)<br>
For those who manually install debian os in their virtual machine, did you remember the
disk partitioning step? Some of you must be wondering what is swap area and why
should i allocate 257MB (or more) for it. This video will answer your question. 
6. [What is Embedded C/C++? Is it different from C/C++?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQBBWvY-s0o)<br>
Some people say C is "human readable" Assembly. Hearing this statement actually make me curious about how
to program a chip (like in POK) with C and by some GSGS i found some article about Embedded C. What is this Embedded C language, is it different from regular C? (spoiler: not really) This video will clear
things up.
7. [TryHackMe! Basic Penetration Testing](https://youtu.be/xl2Xx5YOKcI)<br>
