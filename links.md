Will fill this one soon.

1. [Git and Github in 30 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG4Vs81kMlc)<br>
A video guide by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)
. He will teach you all the basics of git and github if you somehow forget about it
one day lmao. All of this 30 minutes information is enough for you to start using
git and github right after you finish this video. Also check his other vids,
he teaches a lot of good stuff.
2. [Beginner guide to SSH](https://youtu.be/qWKK_PNHnnA)<br>
When i tried to login to my debian vm using SSH, i think it is really cool,
this SSH thing. I want to know how these things works so i searched in youtube
and found this video.
3. [Free and Open Source Licenses](https://youtu.be/Q4GYrcca12c)<br>
Will gives you introduction to some of the most used software license on Free and
Open Source software.
4. [Pointers in C and C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-in-c-and-c-set-1-introduction-arithmetic-and-array/)<br>
Pointers may seems scary for beginner C and C++ programmer, well even for some people who
used C and C++ for a while (like me) still think it's confusing. This website's explanation
on pointers is easy to understand (at least for me). I think this might help you too.
